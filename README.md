# -Charland_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Project Summary:
A collection of vector sorting algorithms, trying to make bubble, quicksort, and insertion for vectors of strings and ints. maybe add a few other useful algorithms, basically a toolbox of code to use whenever.

How to run:
i think it would just be a collection of functions, i may have to make it a class somehow. Probaly the hardest part to implement

Dependencies:
So far, just stl

System requirements:
No idea what this means
